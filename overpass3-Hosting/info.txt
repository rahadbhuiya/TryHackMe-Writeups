CTF Write-Up: Overpass Hosting (THM)

Objective: Capture the Web, User, and Root flags from the target machine to complete the challenge.
1. Information Gathering

We begin with scanning the target machine's open ports and services to gather information:

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp open  ftp     vsftpd 3.0.3
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.0 (protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.37 ((centos))

    FTP (21) is open running vsftpd 3.0.3.
    SSH (22) is open, running OpenSSH 8.0, with valid host keys.
    HTTP (80) is open, running Apache 2.4.37 (CentOS).

2. Web Enumeration with Gobuster

We performed a directory brute force using gobuster to discover hidden directories and files:

gobuster dir -u http://10.10.190.67 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt

Results:

    Discovered multiple directories including .htaccess, .htpasswd, /backups/, and /cgi-bin/.
    The /backups/ directory was found to be interesting as it redirected to another URL.

/backups              (Status: 301) [Size: 236] [--> http://10.10.190.67/backups/]

3. GPG Key Import

We discovered that there was a GPG key involved, and we imported it using the following command:

gpg --import priv.key

This imported the secret key associated with Paradox paradox@overpass.thm.
4. Decrypting the File (CustomerDetails.xlsx.gpg)

Next, we tried to decrypt a file, CustomerDetails.xlsx.gpg, using GPG:

gpg CustomerDetails.xlsx.gpg

However, there was a warning that the secret key had expired:

gpg: WARNING: no command supplied. Trying to guess what you mean ...
gpg: Note: secret key 9E86A1C63FB96335 expired at Tue 08 Nov 2022 04:14:31 PM EST
gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit RSA key, ID 9E86A1C63FB96335

5. SSH Key Generation

At this point, we moved on to generating an SSH key pair. The SSH key was created with the passphrase ShibesAreGreat123:

ssh-keygen

    Saved the private key as sshkey and the public key as sshkey.pub.

The key fingerprint:

SHA256:nh2RT+56hVrqmYSJUGSG50Vrp0+DYAo/r9Iy+P/LofI paradox@ip-10-10-190-67

We will later use this key for authentication.
6. NFS Mounting Attempt

We attempted to mount an NFS share (127.0.0.1:/home/james) using the following command:

mount -t nfs 127.0.0.1:/home/james /home/parrot/nfs

However, there was an error indicating that the --types option is restricted to the root user.
7. Flag Collection
Web Flag:

We accessed the web server and found the web flag as part of the directory enumeration process. The flag is:

Web Flag: thm{0ae72f7870c3687129f7a824194be09d}

User Flag:

We were able to escalate our privileges to user level and obtained the user flag:

User Flag: thm{3693fc86661faa21f16ac9508a43e1ae}

Root Flag:

After gaining root access, we found the root flag:

Root Flag: thm{a4f6adb70371a4bceb32988417456c44}

8. Conclusion

After going through various stages such as enumeration, key management, and privilege escalation, we successfully captured the Web, User, and Root flags for the Overpass Hosting challenge.

    Web Flag: thm{0ae72f7870c3687129f7a824194be09d}
    User Flag: thm{3693fc86661faa21f16ac9508a43e1ae}
    Root Flag: thm{a4f6adb70371a4bceb32988417456c44}

This exercise involved a combination of traditional web exploitation, GPG key handling, SSH key generation, and privilege escalation techniques.
